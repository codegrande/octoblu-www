Even when your devices are connected, it can be difficult for them to work together. Our platform enables you to have devices communicate seamlessly accross multiple protocols. We support HTTP/S, Websockets, COAP, MQTT and AllJoyn.


####Design
Our designer makes automation simple, allowing you to build interactions between devices visually. You can also share, import & export your automated flows.


####Compute
Automated workflows are stored securely and designed to run with high-availability in our cloud.
You can easily design and deploy automated workflows to run 24/7 in sandboxed containers.

####Analyze
With Octoblu, you can gain insights from all data related to your connected
devices. Not only can you visualize data from your connected devices in our platform, you can also easily feed your device data into your existing big-data aggregation tools like Splunk, ElasticSearch and TempoIQ.
