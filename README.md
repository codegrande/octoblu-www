What is octoblu even?

* Connect
    Even when your devices are connected, it can be difficult for them to work together.

* Design
    Our designer makes that simple, allowing you to build automations between anything connected to our platform.

* Compute
    These interactions are stored in our secure cloud, so you don't have to worry about maintaining them.
    Meshblu, our open source mesh network, is always learning. This ensures that your interactions become smarter over time.

* Security
    Security is important to us. That's why we give you complete control over your devices with our revolutionary security model.
