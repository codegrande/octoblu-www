### Talking to devices is hard. We did the hard part, so you don't have to.

###What does that mean!?

####Connect
  - Even when your devices are connected, it can be difficult for them to work together.

####Design
  - Our designer makes that simple, allowing you to build automations between anything connected to our platform.

####Compute
  - These interactions are stored in our secure cloud, so you don't have to worry about maintaining them.

####Security
  - Security is important to us.
  - That's why we give you complete control over your devices with our revolutionary security model.
