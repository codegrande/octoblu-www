### Talking to devices is hard. We did the hard part, so you don't have to.

###With Octoblu you can...

####Connect
Even when your devices are connected, it can be difficult for them to work together. Our platform enables you to have devices communicate seamlessly accross multiple protocols. We support HTTP/S, Websockets, COAP, MQTT and AllJoyn.

#####Connect Detail
- The landscape of connectivity is going to be heterogenous. Whether it is a sensor, cloud service, embedded device or industrial machinery, to Octoblu they are all resources with a unique identifier and properties.  Our device registry allows you to easily connect and securely manage your hardware and software systems.



####Design
Our designer makes automation simple, allowing you to build interactions between devices visually. You can also share, import & export your automated flows.

Our visual designer is powerful enough to handle building complex interactions between resources and simple enough
to use without having to write code. Simply drag, drop, connect and deploy your automations.

####Compute
Automated workflows are stored securely and designed to run with high-availability in our cloud.
You can easily design and deploy automated workflows to run 24/7 in sandboxed containers.

Our compute engines (Octos) allow you to deploy your automations in a secure environment that is flexible enough to run in a cloud, laptop or on a Raspberry PI. You can run your automations in our hosted service or in your own private environment.

####Analyze
With Octoblu, you can gain insights from all data related to your connected
devices. Not only can you visualize data from your connected devices in our platform, you can also easily feed your device data into your existing big-data aggregation tools like Splunk, ElasticSearch and TempoIQ.
